# Acceptance criteria — Provenance Guard

Five criteria that say what "working" means for this service, written in unit 7
**before** you built it.

**All five are yours.** None are given.

An acceptance criterion names a number or something plainly observable. *"The
detector is accurate"* is an opinion — and perfect AI detection isn't possible
anyway, so it's an opinion about something nobody can deliver. *"Of 10 pieces I
wrote myself, at most 1 is labelled high-confidence AI"* is a criterion.

Under each, write a sentence or two on **why that target**. *"I allow at most 1
false positive in 10 because on a writing site a wrong accusation costs more
than a missed detection"* is a real answer.

> Missing your own targets next unit costs you nothing. Setting a target so
> easy you can't miss it does.

## Pick numbers you can defend

**Cover at least three of these five areas.** They're prompts, not a form.

| Area | A question it could answer |
|---|---|
| False positives | How often may a human's writing get called AI? |
| Score spread | How far apart should clearly-AI and clearly-human text score? |
| Label coverage | Is every one of your three labels actually reachable? |
| The appeal path | Does an appeal always change status and always get recorded? |
| Bad input | What happens when `text` is missing, empty, or enormous? |

Two things worth knowing before you pick numbers:

- **The expensive mistake is one-sided.** Missing some AI text costs the site a
  little. Accusing a real writer costs that person a lot. A criterion that
  treats both errors as equally bad is describing a system nobody would ship.
- **Unit 8 tests across three trials, and the target has to hold across all
  three.** Your first signal runs a model, so identical input can score
  differently twice. A target of "at most 1 in 10" against trials of 2, 1, 2 is
  a **miss**.

## 1.

<!-- Your criterion. It must name a number. -->

Across each of three evaluation trials, no more than 1 of 10 pieces of my own
writing is labeled high-confidence AI.

**Why this target:**

Accusing a real writer is more damaging than missing some AI-written text, so
the system should be conservative before showing an AI accusation.

---

## 2.

<!-- Your criterion. -->

In each of three trials, the average combined score for five clearly
AI-generated texts is at least 0.20 higher than the average combined score for
five clearly human-written texts.

**Why this target:**

The system does not need perfect separation, but a visible 0.20 gap gives the
scores useful diagnostic value instead of leaving both groups in the same band.

---

## 3.

<!-- Your criterion. -->

Across the label-coverage test set, all three labels — `human`, `unsure`, and
`ai` — are returned at least once in every trial.

**Why this target:**

Each label is part of the contract. If one cannot be reached, readers either
receive an overconfident result or the label logic has not been meaningfully
tested.

---

## 4.

<!-- Your criterion. -->

For a valid appeal, the service returns HTTP 200 with the submitted
`content_id` and status `under_review`, and appends one appeal entry to the
audit log. For an unknown `content_id`, it returns HTTP 400 and appends no
appeal entry.

**Why this target:**

An appeal must give a real writer a visible remedy while preserving the
original decision. Rejecting unknown IDs prevents the log from claiming that a
nonexistent submission was reviewed.

---

## 5.

<!-- Your criterion. -->

Requests with missing `text`, null or empty `text`, missing `creator_id`, or
more than 12,000 characters receive HTTP 400 with a JSON error message, and
none creates a `decided` entry in the audit log.

**Why this target:**

Malformed or oversized input should fail clearly before model scoring rather
than crashing the service, wasting resources, or creating a misleading
decision record.

     UNIT 8 — read this before you change anything above.

     If a criterion turns out to be BROKEN rather than merely unmet, you can
     revise it, and that earns credit. But never delete or edit the original
     line. Add the revision underneath, like this:

         ## 2. Uncertain cases land in the unsure band

         The system handles uncertain cases well.

         **Why this target:** ...

         > **Revised in unit 8:** Text I judged borderline scores between
         > 0.4 and 0.6 in at least 4 of 5 cases.
         >
         > **Why revised:** "well" gave me nothing to check. I couldn't
         > reach a verdict from it at all.

     That's a revision because the criterion couldn't be MEASURED.

     Lowering a target because you missed it is not a revision, and it costs
     you the point:

         ✗ "At most 1 of 10 of my own pieces flagged as AI" → "at most 3
            of 10", because 1 of 10 turned out to be hard.

     A number you missed stays where it is, gets diagnosed, and gets a fix
     attempted. That's where the points are.
